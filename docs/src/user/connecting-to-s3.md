# S3 Client Options

In order to keep things simple for the end user, less complicated to
maintain on the technical side, but also provide some flexibility over
how content can be uploaded to S3, there is no prescribed user
interface. Any S3-compatible client can be used to interact with the tool.

We believe this is the right choice because there are many popular,
well-supported, and tested options already available. However, we
provide streamlined documentation for the use of the open source program
**Cyberduck** as a downloadable GUI option, the **AWS CLI** for command
line usage, and the web-based browser SFTPGo for the simplest access
point.

Here's a list of clients that have been used or tested by Lyrasis staff:

- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
- [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/)
- [S3Browser](https://s3browser.com/) **(Windows only - we are not providing additional documentation about this option)**
- [SFTPGo](https://sftpgo.com/)

But there are many others and you are free to use any S3 compatible client that you prefer.

After connecting to your S3 account via your preferred method, you will
see the folders already created for your account using your
`dcp-$ID`, including:

- `-managed`
- `-public` (default bucket for files that can be accessed publicly through CloudFront)
- `-request` (used for making create bucket or checksum inventory requests)

## AWS CLI Documentation

### Step 1: Install AWS CLI

[Installing or updating to the latest version of the AWS
CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)

After following the instructions for your operating system, check your
installation:

``` bash
aws --version
```

### Step 2: Configure Your AWS Credentials

[Configuration and credential file settings in the AWS
CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html)

Verify your configuration:

``` bash
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

If you have multiple AWS accounts or environments, set up a named
profile and configure with your key, secret, and region (for example, `us-west-2`):

``` bash
aws configure --profile dcp
```

## SFTPGo Documentation

Navigate to [DuraCloud Preserve](https://preserve.duracloud.org/web/client/login)

Use this web-based interface to log in, upload, and download content.

Individual users will be provided credentials by their system
administrator. The first time you log
in, you will be asked to change your password. You can do this from the
small person icon in the upper-right corner of the screen.

> [!Tip]
After changing your DuraCloud Preserve web client login, **save your new password somewhere securely**.

Note: SFTPGo login sessions are set for 2 hours.

Upon login you will see three folders already created for you:

- `managed`
- `public`
- `request`

From this web-based interface, you may:

- Create new buckets by uploading a request file (see [Creating Buckets](./creating-buckets.md))
- Upload content to buckets, creating subfolder structures as needed
- Download content from buckets
- Download reports and other hosted content from the `managed` bucket

![Provided buckets displayed in SFTPGo web interface showing three bucket folders labeled managed, public and request with upload and download options available](images/dcp-files.png)

> [!Tip]
> Before proceeding, confirm that you are able to successfully connect to S3.
