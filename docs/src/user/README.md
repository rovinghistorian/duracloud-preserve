# Getting started

Whoever is responsible for deployment will provide access
credentials to users.  If you are intending to connect directly to S3
using a desktop graphical user interface (GUI) or command line interface (CLI) tool, then you should receive an **access key** and
**secret**, which serve as a username and password for interacting with
S3. **It is important to treat this as sensitively as you would any
username and password.**

If you are intending to use the web client then you should receive
a **username** (your email address), **password** and the **url** to
login. It's completely fine to use both approaches if you'd like access
to both.

You should also receive a **stack name**, or the name of the institutional account.
  
This will typically be in the form `duracloud-$ID` where `$ID` is an
identifier assigned by those handling the deployment. It may be based on
or similar to a sitecode used by your institution for its domain (e.g.
INSTITUTION.edu).

It is important to know this because your user will only be able to
interact with a subset of buckets in an AWS account that are prefixed
with that stack name. You will also see references to *stack name*
throughout the documentation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before proceeding confirm you have received:
> - Access key (**username)** and secret (**password**) for direct s3
  access if requested
> - Stack prefix (`duracloud-$ID`)
> - Web client **username**, **password** and **url** if requested
