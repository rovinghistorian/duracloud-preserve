# Making Content Public

There are two ways to make content public.

## Pre-created public bucket (recommended)

Each stack includes a pre-created `-public` bucket that is served through a CloudFront distribution with a friendly domain. This is the recommended way to make content publicly accessible. 

Your administrator will provide the public domain URL, but you can also construct what a public link from this bucket will look like based on this pattern:

```text
https://{$ID}.preserve.duracloud.org/{FOLDER STRUCTURE}{FILENAME}
```

So, for example, a .jpg image found in the `test` account's public bucket → photographs → Cats folder structure would look like:

https://test.preserve.duracloud.org/photographs/Cats/callie_and_friend.jpg


### Cyberduck

Navigate to the `duracloud-$ID-public` bucket and upload your files there (see [Uploading Files](./uploading-files.md)). Files uploaded to this bucket will be publicly accessible via the CloudFront domain.

### SFTPGo

Navigate to the `public` folder and upload your content there (see [Uploading Files](./uploading-files.md)). Files placed here will be publicly accessible via the CloudFront domain.

### AWS CLI

```bash
aws s3 cp myfile.jpg s3://duracloud-$ID-public/myfolder/myfile.jpg
```

## Suggestions for public content

Upload smaller file sizes and formats (for example, .jpgs instead of .tiffs) to your `-public` bucket as access copies. Store preservation copies elsewhere in DuraCloud Preserve. Smaller file sizes and formats will download and be viewable more quickly for your users and work with a variety of browser and internet speed limits.

## Creating public buckets (not recommended)

You can also make content publicly available by designating a bucket as `-public` - See [How to Create Buckets](creating-buckets.md).

You can construct what a public link will look like in this scenario based on this pattern:

```bash
https://{BUCKET_NAME}.s3.{REGION}.amazonaws.com/{PREFIX}/{FILE}
```

If you have spaces in any of your folder or filenames, replace those with a + sign when forming a URL. The region information is also optional.

So, for example, an image found in the lyrasis account’s bucket public → test-01 → catpics folder structure would look like:

https://dcp-test-public.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/photographs/Cats/callie_and_friend.jpg

OR, without the region information:

https://dcp-test-public.s3.amazonaws.com/photographs/Cats/callie_and_friend.jpg

**Note this feature is currently available but may be restricted in the future, as it goes against AWS guidelines.**

## Cyberduck sharing options
Cyberduck has some additional ways to share folders and individual objects.
- Navigate to the item you wish to share.
- Right-click on Windows / control+click on a Mac or two-finger click on a touchpad and select "Copy URL" — you can also use the Action (cog) menu and select "Open URL".
  - If you right-click and select "Copy URL," you will have options for how you wish to copy the URL, including HTTPS or HTTP, an expiration on the link (for individual objects only), or the AWS command link.
  - You can now share the item however you wish.
  - The HTTPS and HTTP links may be formed slightly differently (with AWS information before the bucket name), but they should still provide public access to objects in your account.
